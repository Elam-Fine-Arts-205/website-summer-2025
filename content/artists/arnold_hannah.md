My studio project, *Art by Rule*, is an interactive digital art experience that explores the relationship between structure and creativity through a set of predefined drawing instructions. Users engage with four distinct themes—Creative, Patient, Minimal, and Conceptual—each with its own unique set of rules. By clicking on a theme, participants are directed to a separate repository containing the corresponding instructions, allowing them to create art within a structured framework. The project is driven by the coding environment of p5.js, which facilitates interactive visual design through user engagement.

The motivation behind this work stems from an interest in conceptual art and the role of constraints in the creative process. Inspired by Sol LeWitt’s *Wall Drawing #289*, which prioritizes instructions over physical execution, I wanted to investigate how digital tools could extend this philosophy into an interactive and participatory medium. By designing an experience where users follow a predetermined set of rules, the project invites them to explore how structure can facilitate rather than hinder artistic expression.

At its core, *Art by Rule* functions as an inquiry into the generative potential of constraints. By codifying artistic creation into instructions, it highlights the paradox of rule-based art: while limitations impose structure, they also provide a catalyst for interpretation and variation. Each theme presents a different perspective on how rules influence creativity. For example, the “Creative” theme encourages expressive freedom within constraints, while the “Minimal” theme challenges users to reduce elements to their essential form. The interactive nature of the project reinforces the idea that creativity does not emerge from an absence of structure but rather from the negotiation of boundaries.

The work directly engages with the concept of “art from rules” discussed in my contextual research. LeWitt’s emphasis on instructions as art is echoed in my project’s approach to participatory creation. Like *Wall Drawing #289*, *Art by Rule* allows for infinite interpretations while maintaining conceptual consistency. Additionally, Saneef H. Ansari’s computational reinterpretation of LeWitt’s work demonstrates how algorithmic design can preserve artistic intent while expanding its reach. My use of p5.js aligns with this computational approach, reinforcing the idea that digital systems can facilitate rule-based creativity.

The interactive qualities of my project also connect with the ideas explored in Paul’s *A Companion to Digital Art*. Artists like Scott Snibbe and Camille Utterback use algorithmic constraints to shape user interactions, much like *Art by Rule* structures engagement through themed instructions. Snibbe’s Screen series and Utterback’s generative installations exemplify how interactive frameworks guide artistic participation. My project similarly establishes predefined conditions that shape user behavior, demonstrating how digital art relies on structured engagement to generate unique artistic outcomes.

Ultimately, *Art by Rule* challenges conventional notions of artistic authorship by shifting creative agency to the participant. By designing a system where users navigate instructions rather than freely improvising, I emphasize the tension between control and spontaneity. This project reflects a broader artistic and philosophical inquiry into how constraints can foster innovation, aligning with historical and contemporary explorations of rule-based art. Through this structured yet open-ended framework, *Art by Rule* offers a space for experimentation, interpretation, and redefinition of artistic engagement in the digital world.
