This creative work is an interactive work made by code. It is about a person accidentally breaking into another world. In this world, there is a girl living there, so the story starts from the conversation between the girl and the person (which is the user). The main functions I used are buttons and setTimeout. This work is brought together by several branches of dialogue. There are four main blocks of the story - Meeting, Home, School and Back. My motivation for making this work is that I hope to use this work to make people aware of the passage of time and cherish the present time in today's fast-paced era. This work is about people's memories of their childhood and past. The passage of time is like waking up from a dream, and when we realise it, it has already disappeared.

The creative work is involved with many interactivities, which address my chosen theme -
Interactivity. This work is not only using buttons to lead the work to a simple result, the ways of interacting allows the audiences to put themselves into the work. The work is a story about a conversation between a girl and the user. Therefore, the user will be able to interact with the artwork in their own perspective as part of the project. To match the theme, my work mainly focuses on the experiences where the audience participates, not focusing on how good looking the work is. However, I still spend time on the manipulation of the images, use of audios and different Fonts to build an environment for the user to be able to use their emotions and thoughts to interact with my work rather than just mechanically clicking buttons with the mouse.

This work connects with ideas of Olia Lialina’s My Boyfriend Came Back from the War as they both use the conversation to state the narrative and I tried to create my work not using too much linear storytelling in order to give the artwork more possibilities. According to her artwork, I manipulated the images and gave them effects of faded and blurry, it matched my story background - memories. I also made my work separate in different blocks and had the plot continue in each section to imitate the thinking mode of people when recalling - the previous scenes emerge piece by piece like fragments.

To connect with ideas from the chosen text, my work addressed the idea of challenging the consumer culture. For example, Cory Arcangel’s Super Mario Clouds use technology to challenge the consumer expectation of interactivity freedom and make people think about how to engage with digital media in real life. Therefore, my work uses interactive computational art to challenge people's time-wasting behavior on the Internet today, such as watching short videos.
