My creative work visually represents the cognitive overload and disorientation people experience in the era of infinite digital information. The background incorporates a noise effect to emphasize digital instability, with movements intermittently freezing, heightening the chaotic characteristic of Glitch. Additionally, through the webcam, users can see their faces, and random, unpredictable images emerge with each mouse click. My project explores digital instability and the effects of information overload on people.

Exploring the theme of Glitch, I wanted to create something that encourages people to see glitches from a new perspective rather than merely depicting digital system errors. Glitches are often associated with system malfunctions or data corruption. However, similar phenomena can also occur in human cognition. For instance, when we overthink, we can encounter a "mental crash", which could be stuttering or losing track of thoughts, considered a "cognitive glitch." Building on this idea, I moved beyond simple visual errors to express the cognitive overload and disorientation in today's digital world. Nowadays, digital technology is essential, and the constant flow of information often leaves us lost, exhausted, and disconnected from real rest. I want my work to be more than simulated digital chaos, a reminder to pause and reflect, a visual glitch of what we risk losing in infinite information overload.

This project is an interactive Glitch art piece developed using the JavaScript library p5.js. The noise-glitched background uses the noise() function to generate randomly coloured lines that follow the mouse, enhancing digital instability. Initially, the webcam was on the top, but after the feedback, I modified it to be placed under the images. I have made it to draw the webcam on top when images are multiple of 10. I also incorporated the inverted filter to heighten the sense of disorientation and complexity. Interestingly, due to an unexpected coding error, the filter applies itself randomly. I decided not to correct this because this unpredictable motion aligns with the essence of Glitches, where errors become a defining feature of the experience. Through this approach, my work authentically reflects the instability and disorder of digital environments.

'A Vernacular of File Formats' by Rosa Menkman explored Glitch as a unique digital language, showing that file format errors are not just technical failures but a form of digital expression. Inspired by this, I have used Glitch as an artistic tool to depict digital instability in an interactive piece. However, my work simulates the visual characteristics of Glitch, not corrupting or altering data like Menkman. Moreover, Lynne McNeil's 'The End of the Internet' examines how information overload disorients users, especially digital immigrants. My project reflects this by intensifying visual chaos with randomly placed images, heightening confusion. This buildup mirrors how excessive digital content overwhelms individuals, leading to cognitive exhaustion and a sense of being lost.

Through this project, I have learned various meanings and expressions of Glitch. I deeply realized that glitches can be a reinterpretation and art in a digital environment, not just an error. Glitch once again realized that it can be a creative process that reveals the essential limitations of digital technology while also creating unpredictable new visual experiences.
