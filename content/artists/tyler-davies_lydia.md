I have named my work interQUACKtivity, it is a video capture translated to reflect the viewer like a mirror and displayed atop the title and 2 sliders that control the works sensitivity to motion, and the number of motion points captured in each iteration. As the sliders suggest this work detects motion, when motion is detected, ducks appear and they will stay for a few frames and then disappear in the order they were generated, leaving a trail of duck in the direction of motion! I was mostly motivated out of my love of ducks, but I was interested in using motion specifically after doing my contextual research for this project. Golan used computers to highlight unused space in the users silhouettes with ‘Interstitial Fragment Sensor’ and Lozano-Hemmer’s ‘Body Works’ utilised shadows and imbued them with the identities of others through modern projection. On the surface the obvious connection is that both works utilise shadows but more importantly they both utilise the bodies and movements of users to subvert from their usual perceptions of their bodies.

This theme of subverting from the standard perception is what I am trying to engage with in interQUACKtivity, the subversion that I am trying to accomplish is focusing on the journey of the motion rather than the desired outcome of that motion. Our world is one based on productivity and results we don’t focus on the journey but only the results of how we get there. With my motion detecting ducks appearing during the journey of the motion and disappearing as soon as the motion has been completed it draws attention to the beauty of the process of being. It is kind of meditation on impermanence to interact with my work, to sit and move around your arms only interested in the patterns they make, only for them to disappear in the end anyways. The other this that I find interesting exploring with my work is the duality of obscuration, the way I use my ducks to highlight the motion is two sided, because in using a duck to highlight the motion I am also simultaneously obscuring the motion and replacing parts of the viewer for those moments with ducks, imbuing their identity with trails of ducks. I have also added in the sliders to give the viewer agency over how may ducks they are interacting with and how sensitive the interactions are.

Drawing attention to the creation in the viewers motions is meant to be an allusion to the way Golan uses computers to highlight unused space in the users silhouettes with ‘Interstitial Fragment Sensor’. Highlighting the viewers motions by obscuring them with ducks is meant to echo the themes of hijacking identity explored in Lozano-Hemmer’s ‘Body Works’. I did this with the goal of changing the viewers usual perceptions on being in their bodies, and with the intention for engaging with interQUACKtivity to force the viewer’s sole focus on to the process of moving rather than the desired outcome of their movements.
