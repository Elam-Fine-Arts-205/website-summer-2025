The motivation behind my creative work was primarily the idea of non-linearity and the fragmented nature of data storage, drawing inspiration from Lev Manovich and Olia Lialina’s works. I wanted to take the literal aspects from Manovich’s text — how he mentions the CD-ROM data storing structure being linear/structured — and used the imagery of the CD-ROM’s as one of the branches that could be chosen. I also used his idea of the ‘symbolic’ system and how we can use the analogy of the photographs on a CD-ROM as a way of not just seeing the photograph, but by looking at their location in a database and the way that they are organised, we can gain more understanding and see past just the photos. I incorporated the idea of the ‘photo’ and turned it into my distorted webcam system. I wanted to play on the imagery of the photo being distorted, and needing the text over the image, placed in linear rows to create understanding (a play on the linearity of data storage in CD-ROM systems). I incorporated the RiTa function to change the text inputted because I wanted to highlight how the fragmented nature of our thoughts may not be perceived the same by others, alike to the ideas that Manovich talks about in his text; he touches on how in the 00’s and 2010’s, the switch to cloud based data storage systems allowed for fragmented data storage, in turn, allowing people to store data non-linearly, sometimes obscuring the way that we would have been able to understand data being stored on a CD-ROM. The RiTa text function plays on the this theme of fragmentation and the subjectivity of understanding, the unreliability of words we may speak and how they are interpreted by others/ seen by others; hence why we are looking at an image of a person on a webcam as these words are being changed on screen, we are interrogating the self and our understanding of others by looking at ourselves as our words are being changed and the meaning behind them is being mistranslated as it goes through the ‘viewpoint’ or perception of someone else, even if that someone else is a function in code.

The second branch — in the shape of a cloud, makes a reference to the different data storage tools mentioned in Manovich’s text — that someone could go down is inspired more by Lialina’s *Online Newspapers* (2004) and the way she plays on the ideas of fragmentation and unreliability, fostering an environment for self discovery and forming our own options. I wanted my work to be as personalised as hers (she often used GIFs of herself in her work) and by having the user input a journal entry I felt like this was the best way that someone could confront themselves to express their own thoughts and opinions. I still wanted to focus on the idea of Modernist fragmentation and stream of consciousness (non-linear storylines), so I had the diary entries show up on random coordinates of the page, portraying the way our thoughts can come out choppy and disjointed as we think and express them, but when taking a step back, we are able to piece them together in this non-linear way. If we were to find new ways to link different sentences inputted on the pages we would be able to make hundreds of different interpretations of what we were saying depending on our mood, influences that day or what we ate; playing on the theme of subjectiveness of the individual perception and experience.
