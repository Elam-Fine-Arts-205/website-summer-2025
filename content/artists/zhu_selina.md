I was initially inspired by Winnie Soon, her work’s mechanisms of censorship, deletion, and reappearance made me think about cycles. Human thought, too, moves in constant loops, but I wanted to give this abstract, mental process a tangible form. So, I used neural elements as a metaphor for this cycle. For the deeper reflection inspired by her work, I began to see a parallel between this cycle and human thought patterns. Censorship, at its core, is an external force shaping internal choices (ideas), and it made me wonder: do our thought loops also undergo a kind of adjustment or influence, whether from external forces or from some mechanism within ourselves?

In the interactive design of my code, I built a looping logic where “1 persuades 2, 2 persuades 3, and 3 persuades 1.” However, as the interaction progresses, one idea inevitably strengthens and ultimately dominates the others (this was my initial code structure). It led me to question whether the dominance of certain thoughts is gradually shaped under specific influences. In reality, we also struggle between different ideas and choices, some people insist on preserving multiple possibilities, while others let things unfold naturally, allowing one thought to take over.

After further reflecting on the structure of cycles and do contextual research on interactive art, I refined my work to better express this “tension between thoughts.” I added a mechanism in my work where, after clicking, the image collides and gets swallowed. As the viewer repeatedly clicks, the image returns to its original form, a process that symbolizes correction, but also self-selection. Do all ideas coexist, or should they be allowed to develop naturally and be consumed by the dominant one?

At the same time, I began to question: is my work truly open-ended? While the viewer can choose to preserve multiple ideas or let them unfold naturally, does my code still carry an implicit bias in its design? Is this interaction genuinely free, or are viewers subtly guided in ways they may not realize? In this age, the ideas we receive will constantly shape our thoughts, can there ever be a completely independent choice? This led me to reconsider where do the boundaries of interactive art truly lie.

In the end, I see this creation not just as an exploration of interactive art but as a breakthrough in my own way of thinking. Initially, I simply wanted to express the concept of “loop” through code, but throughout the process, I realized it was more about control, surrender, and choice. I created a loop within my work, yet at the same time, I found myself constantly adjusting, dismantling, and recreating within my own cycle. I found that interaction is not just between the viewer and the work, it is a dialogue between oneself and their thoughts, between the individual and the world.
