"Singer Emotion Retrieval" is an interactive visual experience composed of images that move across the screen in response to an input data source. This movement connects with sounds that break into waves based on new values, ultimately forming a painting inspired by my original artwork. The aim is to reflect people's emotions when they input the data. This visual concept is designed to engage the observer to the point where it stops when the communication is interrupted. In the future, this creative work will incorporate an electronic device to retrieve the input data, meaning it will only cease when the human is disconnected from that device.

The creation of this showcase is based on the foundational knowledge I have acquired over the past three weeks. This project primarily involves Javascript and HTML code work, image editing in Photoshop and audio work using the mixing options in Final Cut Pro.

One day, I dreamed of having interactive paintings that could "talk" to people. It leads me to study visual art and architectural technology. I explored designing engineering machines to create movement in the paintings. After finishing my studies, I soon realised that my paintings felt lonely. Simply seeking out new media for expression didn’t develop a sense of companionship or interaction. I concluded that if I could engage my paintings with people, regardless of the medium, I could foster a sense of companionship between them. Like any human relationship, this bond could grow and transform through the exchange of information.

The intrigues of creating a more fluent form of communication by providing opportunities for mutual companionship through data interaction, retrieval, action, and delivery. This process can evolve into something ethereal, relying on sharing emotions with a machine. Even though machines do not feel, we may believe that they do, and this shift in perception could alter our understanding of art.

Paintings may evolve into a combination of sound frequencies, colours, and movements that trigger psychological reactions in people. This could have serious consequences, especially if the observer interacting with the painting has health issues. However, through these paintings, we may also gather enough information to identify specific moments that negatively affect observers.

My work shows people's emotional states; I am retrieving data on a specific mental stage, using a value that physically represents their emotional state. Recently, I read an article that discusses the word "flow" as a powerful force in art creation. The article investigates the behaviour of multiple individuals with mental illness and their interaction with art. The findings are fascinating; the data suggests that creating art allows participants to enter a mental state where they detach from cognitive processes. “The participants describe an acceleration, an increasing surrender to the ‘thing being created,’ resulting in a flow or hyper concentration, a movement toward a place where time no longer matters” . This detachment enables them to break free from their usual thought patterns and engage in a direct emotional experience. This is precisely what my artwork aims to achieve: to provide an emotional experience.

My obsession with the possibility of retrieving human emotions drove me to develop this concept.
However, since my knowledge wasn't sufficient to make it fully interactive using devices and new technology, I devised a way for the observer to input data and interact with the code. This approach lets me retrieve heart rate information, which triggers the code to execute sound files. I then analyse these files to create frequency values that modify the painting displayed on the screen. This interaction creates a reaction based on the observer's emotional state. In the future, to fully understand how humans may respond to different emotions and experiences, I need to include a device that can continuously monitor changes in the individual, responding to how they are affected by the alterations in the image.

My artwork integrates Simon Ingram's artistic concept and Lev Manovich's theoretical framework.
Ingram's approach emphasises interactivity, drawing upon data from the surrounding environment, while my project focuses on data derived from a human input source, specifically, the sharing of heart rate information. Also, my visual artwork represents the ideas in the text where the writer talks about disrupting standard narratives and avoiding fixed narrative structure by incorporating elements that work as paradigms; this intentionally leaves open spaces for the observer's interpretation. By doing this, I facilitate creative communication that allows participants to envision their meanings within the visual work using the machine.
