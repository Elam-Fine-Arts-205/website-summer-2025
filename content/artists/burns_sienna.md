My artwork, *Simulated 95*, is as the title suggests, a simulation of an old Windows 95 desktop. For this work, I was inspired by the early internet and its culture, as well as my concept of what it was like as someone not around at that time. Its meaning lies in its imperfections - I wanted it to perform as a false memory of the time, a look back at the idea of the old internet with rose-tinted glasses. I was motivated to approach the theme of Digital Folklore from this perspective as modern day technology is often synonymous with the negative side of social media. I am fascinated by the way that culture has developed online. 

To address my theme of Digital Folklore head on, I looked into the subtleties of the culture at the time and tried to connect this into my work. I researched the old Windows Desktops, and added these aspects to my project. The old forum, media players and website were not only based on real early Windows, but also the surrounding culture at the time. I attempted to weave the idea of Digital Folklore through the visual aspects of the artwork, as well as the way it was coded. There are a few bugs in the work - some things don’t run very smoothly – but I feel my basic level of coding experience adds to the idea of old Windows. Nothing ran very well back then.

*Simulated 95* was based around the way that Olia Lialina drew references to the digital space in her work, *My Boyfriend Came Back From The War*. I was inspired by her use of GIFs and how this reflected the time that the artwork was made so well. In my work, whilst I was making a representation of an old browser, I also wanted to make references to modern day technology to create a contrast and connect the modern audience of the digital age. Another aspect of Lialina’s work that inspired me was her willingness to engage with the medium. She fully embraces what it means to be a piece of early digital art, and I wanted to emulate this in my artwork as well. I wanted to embrace the quirks of using code as a medium, as well as its aesthetics. As Lialina does not shy away from the imperfections of early GIFs, I decided not to shy away from the imperfections that come with being a beginner coder.

I also found that my philosophy of the project reflected what Ernest Edmonds discusses in *Algorithmic Art Machines*. In his article, Edmonds discussed his fascination with the coming of the digital age in the 1970s. I found his fascination apparent throughout his whole article, and it helped me to question what the driving forces behind the early internet and the early digital artspace were like. I wanted to engage with the feeling of awe for the computer in my work. The way the work is designed requires the user to open each window and find the aspects that can be interacted with. I wanted it to feel like the way that the digital space feltback then and now - like there are endless possibilities for what technology can be.
