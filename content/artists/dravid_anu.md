My p5.js project explores the theme of art from rules, drawing on Simon Ingram’s Automata Paintings and Philip Galanter’s generative art framework. The project simulates neural connectivity through autonomous digital agents, where structured rules guide emergent behaviours, allowing an evolving network of interactions to develop.

Simon Ingram’s Automata Paintings influenced my approach by demonstrating how self-generating systems create complex forms through repeated actions. Like Ingram’s machines, my neurons function as independent agents governed by predefined rules, forming dynamic and unpredictable connections. This process mirrors neural self-organization, where repeated interactions strengthen connections, reinforcing structured but evolving networks. Ingram’s approach to machine-driven mark-making inspired my decision to relinquish full control over composition, allowing the system itself to dictate form through programmed logic.

Philip Galanter’s concept of complexity emerging from simplicity guided my implementation of random movement, size changes, and deactivation periods. Inspired by his distinction between stochastic and deterministic generative systems, I balanced randomness with structured constraints, ensuring neurons interact organically yet systematically. This reflects biological synaptic plasticity, where neural pathways adapt based on usage. By setting parameters adjusting neuron size according to number of connections, I introduced a visual indicator of neural activity, reinforcing that structured rules lead to emergent complexity.

My project also explores computational authorship, aligning with Galanter’s and Ingram’s perspectives on autonomous artistic systems. By defining interaction rules instead of manually controlling neuron placement, I shifted from creator to system architect, allowing the program to generate unexpected patterns. This computational co-authorship mirrors how biological systems evolve based on environmental stimuli, reinforcing emergent creativity within constraints. The ability of neurons to grow/shrink based on real-time connections introduces adaptation, reinforcing how rule-based generative art can feel both structured and responsive.

Another key influence was the neural refractory period, which I incorporated by introducing temporary deactivation after firing, preventing neurons from forming continuous connections. This rule-based limitation ensured that the system remained fluid, reflecting both biological inhibition mechanisms and computational constraints. The dynamic shift between active and inactive states mirrors real-world neuronal activity, where over-activation leads to system instability, requiring built-in regulatory mechanisms.

One challenge was balancing randomness and structure. Early iterations led to chaotic, disconnected networks, while overly rigid rules stifled organic growth. Refining connection thresholds and movement parameters helped simulate an adaptive yet rule-driven system. I adjusted deactivation times to ensure interactions unfolded in structured yet evolving ways, reinforcing the project’s alignment with rule-based emergence. Through iterative testing, I learned minor adjustments to rule constraints had significant effects on overall composition, demonstrating how generative systems respond sensitively to small parameter changes.

This project deepened my understanding of generative systems as dynamic processes, where constraints enable rather than limit creativity. Through studying Ingram and Galanter, I realized rule-based art can produce expressive, complex outputs beyond direct human control. The interplay of machine autonomy and structured interaction reshaped my perception of authorship, demonstrating how computational frameworks generate compelling, emergent compositions. My project reflects tension between predictability and spontaneity, emphasizing how computational art can simulate biological organization while maintaining some algorithmic unpredictability.
