This creative work is the outcome of my overall interest and learning from this course. Taking heavy inspiration from ASDFG by JODI, I looked into the randomness and breaking down of the software - showcasing its architecture. This work looks to first showcase a basic animation of a ball bouncing around and off from the screens of the user's windows. This basic animation is a simple visual coding exercise that leads into a glitched phase, showcasing the backbones of this code and breaking the user's perspective of what is happening. Creating an unexpected moment of where the underlying code is revealed in a flash of unrecognisable text for the user, showcasing basic network information and variables that the user wouldnt see from the frontend side of things.

This was made with p5.js, using two websites and sketches that were separated by the bouncing ball animation and the glitches. After some time, the websites will switch to the other. To create that illusion of the ball bouncing animation breaking for the user.

I was motivated to create this work as I have always loved the visual aspects of glitches; they take the user out of the world, look so fascinating and somewhat chaotic. When glitches happen at first, you get this first moment of a scare before the fascination and enjoyment of the work that can only be emulated with technology and computational arts. Looking to showcase the inner workings of a network computational art by showcasing data collected by the website and by the program and visualising it to the users. In a manner, they wouldnâ€™t fully understand.

I wanted to showcase this visual glitch effect between a straightforward ball animation to showcase the juxtaposition between the simple animation and the glitches better.

This work addresses my theme of glitches by creating these false glitches to the user, breaking down their own network and browser to hold this artwork in. The randomness of this work within its glitched effects. Breaking down the user's easy viewing experience with a bouncing ball and what they are really looking at.
