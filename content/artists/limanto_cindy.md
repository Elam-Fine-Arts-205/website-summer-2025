Recycle 2040 is an artwork that represents the current world’s problems. According to UNSDG number 6, "Clean Water & Sanitation” ensures access to water and sanitation for all. Access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene is the most basic human need for health and well-being (United Nations, 2018). As I am an Indonesian, and I want to make something related to my background, I searched about the issues in Indonesia, and one of them is clean water sanitation in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, which is bad and undrinkable (Teoman, 2024).

Tons of waste from factories along the shores of the rivers that flow through the metropolis are dumped directly into the waters, in addition to raw domestic waste from millions of homes that end up in the city's waterways (Sonda, International, n.d.). Dumping waste into rivers can cause the water to become turbid and odorous. To resolve that, Jakarta needs to learn how to properly manage waste, such as separating recyclable from non-recyclable waste. Regular river cleaning is essential to restore cleanliness after being polluted by waste (Smart City Jakarta, 2024).

Knowing there’s a water pollution issue in my own country motivated me to create this project, wanting to let others know more about situations happening in Indonesia. This project is based on factory pollution, water quality that is shown by the river, and recycling. Starting by making concepts, creating an image collection, making the art with the collage art style, and finally coding it while asking for feedback. There was some layering of images, with the if-else conditionals to create buttons that create interactivity with the users and allow users to get their own outcomes depending on their choice.

Starting from figure 8, which is the starting point of the page, the factory shows how the factory in Jakarta. There are rivers and trash on the road, allowing users to choose which way the trash will end up depending on the arrow that the users choose. Since the theme is interactivity, the users can choose their way, allow the trash to go to the rivers or recycle them. Figure 9 shows if the trash is going to the river. Then figure 10 shows if the trash is going to the recycle. On the git hub, there will be some animation showing the trash walking from the factory to the endpoint. After the trash goes to the desired destination, another message will be shown to see if they’re successful in saving Jakarta or not. Figure 11 shows if they’re successful. There is a picture of the bright city, which means lively, with the hand and crown representing the victory. Moreover, there are two figures called Ondel-ondel to represent the protectors of evil as in this art, the bad environment and pollution are evil (Itsnaini, 2021). In addition, in Figures 9 & 12, the hourglass represents the time ticking until 2040.

As Cheang’s works use the button, I’m inspired to make the users choose their own decisions to have their own outcomes. However, I wish that this artwork would be more interactive using the camera to detect and create the output and allowing more movement and different outcomes with more unpredictable dynamic scenes instead of just 2 limited outcomes.
