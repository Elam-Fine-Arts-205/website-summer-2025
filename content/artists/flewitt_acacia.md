As I have been working on my project, I have been having internet issues, so my code has taken longer to load, slowing down my overall process, which is obviously frustrating, but I have persevered. I started by creating an index of folklore creatures I am interested in, assigning each as a button for the user to select and build their own collage based on what they want to see. I liked this idea as I feel the way we interact in the current digital space is very self-motivated, so allowing the user the freedom to create what they want to see mimics how they would interact with their social media. However, this didn’t feel like enough, so I went back to the drawing board and started to look more towards my chosen artist to figure out how to layer information more interestingly without taking away from the theme of digital folklore. From this, I built a background and re formatted it so the web page resembles the setup of Instagram. Instead of creating a college, users would flicker through images like Instagram.

For me, looking at digital folklore felt more like looking into the past of what the internet started as, and I wanted to bring in more of the feeling of the current age and distort that by only allowing the viewed content to be on the topic of traditional folklore. Bringing it back to the idea of seclusion on the internet, as I discussed in my commentaries.

Overall, I am happy with my idea, but I think it will take longer to flesh this out digitally. I feel as though I still believe in a more traditional medium format, so I continue to struggle with fleshing out my ideas in code. I want to continue learning and branching out my skills, but unfortunately, I don’t think I have utilised my time efficiently enough to complete it within the time frame of this course. I will work on this as a hobby, and I’m excited to see where to bring these skills.
