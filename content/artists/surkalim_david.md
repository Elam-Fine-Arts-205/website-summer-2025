Since I have chosen the theme of ‘glitches’ it would only be appropriate for my creative work to utilize glitches in some way which I have in my attempt at making some objects on a canvas and have them simulate a ‘glitch out’ when the user’s mouse hovers above it. The work simulates ‘glitching out’ because it reflects the idea of glitch art being the result of precise deliberate manipulations which appear chaotic and random and if my artwork is able to simulate ‘glitching out’ as well as glitch art then it should be as effective as causing actual glitches. I mainly used javascript to make the objects that are laid out in the canvas and I used a random function for the movement and to generate the colours when the objects simulate ‘glitching out’. When first thinking about making an art piece based on the theme ‘glitches’ I wanted to make a piece that looked relatively normal at first but then the piece would start to glitch and reveal the actual look of the piece (sort of like a Jekyll and Hyde situation for the art piece). Whenever making pieces of art I don’t really think of any hidden meanings or thematic ideas but while using my knowledge that I have gained from my research I suppose that the audience could gather the idea that not everything is as it seems from a surface level understanding. However, if we go one level further we could suppose that the objects could symbolise people as individuals and that they may seem put together on the outside but if we move the mouse closer to the objects we could assume that when the objects ‘glitches out’ that this could be akin to seeing the troubles that people may go through the closer you are to them as a person and that different colours that each object glitches to represents the different the individual troubles showing that not everyone goes through the same thing. This potential meaning comes from the research I have done where in the text ‘Chroma Glitch – Data as Style’ there is a small section where they talk about how glitches are used to represent the anxiety or troubles in our society and from Rosa Menkman’s ‘A VERNACULAR OF FILE FORMATS – A GUIDE TO DATABEND COMPRESSION DESIGN’ in the opening section she says something about glitches being something that doesn’t ‘offers any stimulus’. Overall, they all talk about glitches as something generally unwanted by society but they all revolve around glitches because it has become a popular type of trend that has entered into the mainstream and because they are people that see the chaos in the glitch and view it as something desirable.
