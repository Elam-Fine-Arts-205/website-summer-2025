My work is a linear story disguised as a pet game, at several steps the user is told to interact with the work in a way to reach certain goals, however these goals are unreachable and the user will be moved through the same ‘acts’ of the work no matter what. The only way to meaningfully alter the user experience is to exit the work. To create the work I used vscodes p5js environment, as well as some visual + audio assets that belong to myself. From the beginning of the project the first ideas that came to mind were game-like interactive simulations, due to the work being hosted on the internet I assumed, without much thought, that it should invite a level of interactivity resulting in user desired/ specific outcomes. While writing my response to Olia Lialina’s work *My Boyfriend Came Back From The War*, I found myself trying to frame the lack of user generated outcome as a result of limited thought/ capability due to the newness of the internet at the time. However I realised that this line of thinking was due to my own expectations of the internet as a tool for *myself*, I became interested in how this perception could be given shape.

Desire being actuated through the conduit of interactivity is something I attempted to realise in my own piece. Interactivity – that is, what we click and why – is necessarily linked to desire because human agency concretises desire. As Lacan writes, human agency and desire embody the pursuit of the unattainable *objet petit a*. The important qualification to this is that agency in my interactive art pieces is illusory — volition is constrained because there are limited options for expression (feed, play, and tricks). Thus, in my piece, there is embodied agency, but desire cannot be realised (just as in Lialina’s work) as every possible option eventuates in the pet being “lost”. In this way, linear interactive screen art provides an interesting foundation upon which to explore what it means for interactivity to contain embodiment.

Goal-oriented interactivity is a concept mentioned by Nathaniel Stern, who appears notionally opposed to a user being “instrumentalised”, which “limits” (314) their ability to relationally embody themselves via an interactive artwork. As per my research on Lacan and Lialina, my piece asks what it means to embody (at least in an agentive sense) insofar as embodiment and agency relates to and concretises desire. There being a constantly elusive goal allows for my piece to consider what it means to “win”, or what it means to continue to pursue the *objet petit a* in relation to how embodiment’s “incipient activity” (310) is constitutive of agentive action. As such, I consider my artwork in a broader dialogue with interactivity’s two pillars – desire and embodiment, as I attempt to decenter these concepts, where “relationality is amplified as always more than what we, as humans, do and perceive.”

Stern writes that interactive artworks can “create situations that enhance, disrupt, and alter experience and action in ways that call attention to our varied relationships with and as both structure and matter”. With respect to these dual relationships, I wanted to consider how linearity and/or relational choice in interactive media is often informed by instantiating or symbolically materialising the *objet petit a* (or, broadly, human purpose generally) as *attainable* — video games often end in “winning”, etc. But as these are mere representations or attempts to symbolically order the *objet petit a* (which in the register of human experience would not be possible). In that sense, it is only an underwhelming figment of desire – my piece can be likened to Cory Arcangel’s *Super Mario Clouds* in that sense (323). These are the interesting aspects of interactivity which I considered in my creative process.
