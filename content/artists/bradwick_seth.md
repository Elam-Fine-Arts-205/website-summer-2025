Synesthetic Composition 0 is a coding based moving image work, centred around the visio-spatialization of data within 3d space. Taking synaesthesia, a condition where non-visual sensory stimulus is perceived visually, as a concept underpinning the work, this was applied to the translation of audio into visual form, via data.

Beginning by breaking down audio into raw data, a song (format .wav) was expressed as discrete data units sampled at 0.42 Hz. In simple language, 420 discrete dB values were taken per second (to a final count of just under a million values), and listed sequentially. These dB values then formed the core dynamic component of the visualiser, applied based on artistic choice and aesthetic value. As the code ran through various state changes, these values were applied to object orientation, size, rotation and speeds of changes in the aforementioned.

The resulting final piece is driven by pure numerical data, correlating and {in}directly translating audible experience into visual experience. Whilst the presentation of the data was driven by an intuitive approach to the visualisation, making “arbitrary” visual decisions based on aesthetic judgement, rather than sticking to a purely conceptual approach. In terms of a continuing artistic practice however, I am unsure about the critical validity of the visualiser format, specifically in this form. Whilst yes, there is almost no limit to the technical experimentation and development that this format entails, conceptually I’m uncertain that there can be further development, at least without re-approaching the audio sourcing/visual outputting in a novel way that I am yet to discover. In a sense, this workflow almost feels more akin to a craft than contemporary art, and I fail to see how to deepen its meaning.

The digital materiality proposed by Menkman is absent in this piece, and my technical experience rendered attaining an understanding of this out of reach. Whilst this may change after closer examination of a wider range of New Media artists and work, said examination is yet to be begun. Overall though, I would deem this project successful, and the technical experimentation and process solidified a solid base of coding skills.
