My creative work is called ‘clickbait’. Visual glitch events, triggered upon the users click bait the user into clicking more - at the cost of changing the previous frame, which cannot be recreated. Though the work is coded, and each user will receive the same input, this is a work that is influenced by user interactivity, such that the output or *saved image* will vary from person to person. However, the user does not have control over what, only *when*.

This idea first started as a more aesthetically based work. I really liked my workshop 3 exploration - the gradual change of the image over time. This led into thought exploration in the ideas about decay - and I thought, why not be the physics nerd I am and create a piece that represents this gradual chaos called entropy? I could replace the tint with glitch effects - the more the user clicks, the more the image distorts, representing the idea where the chaos, or entropy of the universe tends to a maximum; where freezing life itself is the only way to delay it. The importance of this idea lies in the fact that the events will only trigger if the user clicks. The distortion of the image gets worse as you continue to click away, beginning with slight changes before becoming exponentially more distorted. However, you can stop at anytime.

Some people may not trigger some events before deciding enough is enough. Whether that be because they are happy with the current frame, or because their patience has run thin. Both these reasons can be reflections of the state where something will remain frozen and unchanging if not affected by any external events - whether that be in a state of completion or abandonment.

Another aspect of this is the fact that *you can never return to a previous image*. With no undo button, and computer-generated randomness, you are unable to return to an exact past version of a glitched image once you have decided to move on. The concept of ‘undoing’ really only erupted with the digital age. The act of undoing in the real world will leave traces, creases, scars, but the digital world provides a pristine, riskless ‘undo’. Living in the digital realm for too long can make one forget about the gambles of life itself - to do or not to do. Things like consumption. Use breaks things down, but if you leave it as it is it will remain pristine. Blissful Ignorance. The more you think, the more problems you discover. Even over whipping cream is an example of this.

Rather than exploiting processes like Menkman, in my work the aesthetic of the glitch itself is intentionally coded, and more focused on their symbolistic meaning. Pseudo-randomness is used to generate an ‘unpredictable’ chaos. To control this chaos, as suggested by ‘Chroma Glitch’ it’s balanced with intervalled repetition, and environmental connections via audio to create a subconcious balance of order within the chaos. If I became more familiar with the ins and outs of the computer language, actually exploiting processes as used by glitch artists would be something that I would like to explore further.
