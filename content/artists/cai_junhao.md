My creative work is an interactive sound and video experience using p5.js. It features a ball that moves based on the user's voice pitch and changes color with sound amplitude. The ball interacts with the webcam feed and sound bars, bouncing off black and dark colors.

The motivation behind this project was to explore the theme of "interactivity" by engaging users through both visual and auditory elements. The webcam feed adds a personal touch, making each experience unique and emphasizing user participation. I want to make an interative experience with out any touch, users are making impact to the art work without any need of pressing buttons or touch.

This work addresses the theme by allowing users to influence the visual output in real-time. The ball's movement and color changes create a feedback loop that encourages continuous interaction. The sound bars add a dynamic challenge, requiring users to making sound to navigate the ball. And it can be used with many people.

In my contextual research, I explored Olia Lialina's "Do You Believe in Users?" and Cory Arcangel's "Super Mario Clouds." Lialina's work emphasizes the role of users in digital culture, highlighting their active participation and influence. This inspired me to create an experience where users are central to the artwork's behavior. Arcangel's "Super Mario Clouds" strips a familiar video game down to its simplest elements, focusing on the aesthetic and conceptual impact of minimalism. This influenced my decision to use simple visual elements and real- time interaction to create a meaningful experience.

Overall, this interactive experience makes the user an active participant, creating a multi-sensory engagement that hopefully resonates. And the audiance can feel the relation between sound, noise and inner peace. How it is different when you are in peace compared to "noise". And "look at yourself"
