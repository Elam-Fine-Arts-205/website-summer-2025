In this project, I selected four classic paintings by Van Gogh, Almond Blossoms, Sunflower, Wheat field with Crows and Snowy Landscape, representing the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. I used computer technology to paint Van Gogh's paintings step by step using dots. It also changes according to spring, summer, autumn, and winter, allowing the audience to appreciate Van Gogh's painting process and the four seasons in Van Gogh's eyes.

I chose Ps5.js as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE). First, I imported the downloaded photos and read them in the order of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Then, I use the edge detection algorithm to describe the edges of four Van Gogh paintings. I defined a series of line segments with different lengths and widths. I used the In-house color extraction algorithm to make the color of line segments fit the area I wanted to depict as much as possible. I gradually used the defined line segments to describe the edge of Van Gogh's painting so as to complete the painting. The algorithm was applied to the other three paintings, and the rotation was carried out in the order of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

The theme I chose was "Art in Rules," I used several rules and algorithms during the creation process to complete our artwork. Our work highlights how to create something artistic with the help of rules and computer logic. This explores the relationship between algorithms and art and shows how order and creativity can be combined, perfectly echoing the theme of "Art in rules." 

This project has a lot to do with the ideas in my background research. The article I read discussed how ordinary people can create through digital technology, which inspired my work. In particular, how the artist Cory Arcangel used digital tools to recreate existing works made me realize that I could also use modern digital tools to reinterpret Van Gogh's work. Arcangel innovates based on the original works through technical means, which makes me think that digital means can help me reproduce and reinterpret Van Gogh's art. I took inspiration from his paintings and adapted them through technology. This way of combining modern technology and traditional art allowed me to understand digital art's creation better and see the great potential of algorithms and technology in art. These studies provide the direction for my works and guide me to make new attempts in my creation.
