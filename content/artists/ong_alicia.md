My chosen theme for this assignment was interactivity, which I associate with user participation and the ability to influence outcomes through choice. However, I wanted to push the boundaries of the meaning behind the theme. The main idea is to create an illusion of choice, while the work appears interactive, it is truthfully purposefully curated that the user's actions are ultimately constrained.

My work builds upon concepts developed from previous workshops, particularly workshop 4 and 9 which received good feedback. It was also a matter of whether I could execute what I had in mind. The piece begins with a flashlight effect, made to be in a dark space to look for the hidden button. Upon finding it, they are taken to a newPage which mimics a light like it had been switched on from the black and dull sight to something brighter. From there, instructions are given: Do NOT OFF. However, due to the way it is structured, the user is forced to click it. This triggers a chaotic sequence of overlapping images and sounds, creating a disturbing environment in contrast to the previous. A "restart" button appears after a setlnterval, it appears long enough to be visible but not enough to be clicked on. This creates a sense of hopelessness and trapping the user in the experience.

The concept of my work draws from artist JODI and Andy Deck. While Andy Deck's work does not rely on deception, I experienced a feeling of overwhelming when accessing Calendar which influenced my approach. JODl's My%Desktop serves as a point of reference as both their work and mine are almost paralleled with disruptions and disorientation. However, my piece differs as it tricks and forces the user to a predetermined outcome. Additionally, Carolyn L. Kane's *Avant-Garde Glitch: Red Noise, Purple Haze, Black Box* in *High-Tech Trash* influenced my aesthetic choices. The discussion of glitch aesthetics, particularly fragmentation in "red noise," resonated with me, leading me to incorporate similar visual distortions into my work.

Despite its deception, my piece still aligns with the theme of interactivity as it is entirely dependent on user engagement. Interactivity goes beyond clicking a few buttons. In this case, the evoking feelings of discomfort and exploration that I encourage in my works can also be aligned with interactivity from the artist to their audience.
