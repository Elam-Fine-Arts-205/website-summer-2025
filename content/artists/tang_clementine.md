I have come to realise that the concept of interactivity is deeply embedded in our lives and experiences, far beyond the realm of technology and art. As we grow, our very understanding of the world is shaped through our interactions. Whether through physical touch, listening to sounds, or engaging in conversations, these interactions build the foundation of our knowledge and shape how we relate to the world around us. Similarly, art that invites viewer participation transforms the experience from passive observation into a shared dialogue between the artwork and the individual. This active participation fosters an intimate connection, enabling viewers to engage not only with the artwork itself but also with the emotions and ideas it embodies. This is where I find the beauty in interactive art—it bridges the gap between the artist and the audience, transforming both from distinct entities into collaborators in the creative process.

In the case of my own interactive sound-based artwork, this principle of interaction becomes even more apparent. By using sound as a medium to drive the creation of the artwork, I have incorporated an element that everyone can relate to, as sound is something we all experience daily. What I find most exciting is the immediacy of this interaction. As the viewer's voice or noise directly influences the drawing process, their input becomes a tangible part of the artwork. It is no longer a one-way process, where the artist simply presents an idea, but a two-way dialogue in which the viewer’s actions have a direct and visible impact. The experience becomes dynamic, unpredictable, and unique to each interaction. Each sound wave generated by the participant’s voice becomes an integral part of the creative process, leaving a trace of their presence on the canvas.

This sound interaction also connects with the core idea of how we learn and experience the world. Much like how babies use sensory interaction to form an understanding of their environment, sound-based interaction allows viewers to gain a more intimate connection with the artwork. As sound levels affect the movement and the appearance of the lines, each gesture—whether through speech or noise—dictates the pace and direction of the visual expression. This deeper involvement fosters a stronger emotional engagement, making the work feel less like a finished product and more like a living, evolving process. Just as we navigate our world through interaction, this artwork invites the viewer to engage directly, to shape it with their presence, and to influence its trajectory. Ultimately, this interaction transforms both the viewer and the artwork, making them co-creators in an ongoing, dynamic relationship. This is the essence of interactive art—the creation of meaning through mutual participation, where every voice, sound, and movement has the potential to shape and redefine the work.
